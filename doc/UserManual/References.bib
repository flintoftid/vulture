	or calculated frequency domain responses with rational function approximations.
	This is achieved by replacing a set of starting poles with an improved
	set of poles via a scaling procedure. A previous paper (Gustavsen
	et al., 1997) described the application of the method to smooth functions
	using real starting poles. This paper extends the method to functions
	with a high number of resonance peaks by allowing complex starting
	poles. Fundamental properties of the method are discussed and details
	of its practical implementation are described. The method is demonstrated
	to be very suitable for fitting network equivalents and transformer
	responses. The computer code is in the public domain, available from

Both the magnetic and electric shielding may be calculated as a function of frequency, enclosure dimensions, aperture dimensions and position within the enclosure. Theoretical values of shielding effectiveness are in good agreement with measurements. The theory has been extended to account for circular apertures, multiple apertures, and the effect of the enclosure contents},

abstract={Standard point source modeling in the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method has been accomplished by centering the source at the appropriate electric or magnetic field node in a given Yee cell. While this methodology is adequate for many applications, it produces a source whose Cartesian oriented field components have slightly different phase centers, which yields a visible propagation delay between these components. For phase sensitive applications, more accurate consideration of the source phase center may be required. In this study, we introduce a means of producing point sources with coincident phase centers. We will show that these sources provide good accuracy at close distances to the phase center while outperforming the standard sources in the near field when an arbitrary direction of the point source moment is required.},

  edition = {Online},
  abstract = {This book provides a broad and applications-oriented introduction
        to electromagnetic waves and antennas. Current interest in these
        areas is driven by the growth in wireless and fiber-optic communications,
        information technology, and materials science.
        
        
        Communications, antenna, radar, and microwave engineers must deal
        with the generation, transmission, and reception of electromagnetic
        waves. Device engineers working on ever-smaller integrated circuits
        and at ever higher frequencies must take into account wave propagation
        effects at the chip and circuit-board levels. Communication and computer
        network engineers routinely use waveguiding systems, such as transmission
        lines and optical fibers. Novel recent developments in materials,
        such as photonic bandgap structures, omnidirectional dielectric mirrors,
        birefringent multilayer films, surface plasmons, negative-index metamaterials,
        slow and fast light, promise a revolution in the control and manipulation
        of light and other applications. These are just some examples of
        topics discussed in this book.
        
        
        The book is organized around three main topic areas:
        
        
         * The propagation, reflection, and transmission of plane waves, and
        the analysis and design of multilayer films.
        
         * Waveguides, transmission lines, impedance matching, and S-parameters.
        
         * Linear and aperture antennas, scalar and vector diffraction theory,
        antenna array design, and coupled antennas. 
        
        
        The text emphasizes connections to other subjects. For example, the
        mathematical techniques for analyzing wave propagation in multilayer
        structures, multisegment transmission lines, and the design of multilayer
        optical filters are the same as those used in DSP, such as the lattice
        structures of linear prediction, the analysis and synthesis of speech,
        and geophysical signal processing. Similarly, antenna array design
        is related to the problem of spectral analysis of sinusoids and to
        digital filter design, and Butler beams are equivalent to the FFT.},
